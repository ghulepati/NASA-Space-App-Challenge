🌍 Expurgo Re-Tyre
NASA Space Apps Challenge Submission

Author: Sai Ghule

🚀 Overview

Expurgo Re-Tyre is an innovative environmental technology concept developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge.

It proposes a strap-on, multi-layered emission-absorbing tyre pad that actively absorbs harmful gases such as CO₂, CO, and SO₂ directly from the environment as vehicles move.

🌫️ Problem Statement

Air pollution is a growing global crisis.

76% of Indians live in areas that do not meet national air quality standards

Air pollution impacts:

Birth weight

Child growth

Obesity

Bladder cancer

Children and elderly populations are disproportionately affected

Awareness remains low, with only 19% of Indians fully understanding the severity of air pollution.

💡 Proposed Solution
Expurgo Re-Tyre Pad

A multi-layer emission-absorbing pad that can be fitted onto vehicle tyres.

🔬 How It Works

The tyre pad contains three functional layers, each serving a specific purpose:

Gas absorption layer (hydrated sodium carbonate-based compound)

Structural support layer

Protective outer layer

As the vehicle moves, the pad absorbs harmful gases from the surrounding air.

📊 Scientific Viability

Hydrated sodium carbonate achieves:

282 mg/g CO₂ absorption within 60 minutes

Product is:

Easy to install

Cost-effective

Recyclable

Active pollution control solution

📱 Smart App Integration

The project integrates hardware with a mobile application to enhance user engagement and awareness.

Features

Real-time tracking through embedded sensors

Cloud-based data processing

Machine Learning model for user-specific analysis

Interactive dashboards & graphs

Route tracking

Life expectancy impact updates

🎮 Gamification Strategy

To increase adoption and awareness:

Users see visual dashboards of gases absorbed

Earn badges for contribution milestones

Share achievements on social media

Encourage behavioral change through social incentives

Research shows visualizations improve understanding across all age groups, making gamification a powerful engagement tool.
