This repository contains multiple versions of the Expurgo Re-Tyre project:

1. **Technical Draft Version**  
   The original hackathon submission focused on environmental research, data modeling, absorption projections, and system architecture.

2. **School Outreach / Kid-Friendly Version**  
   A simplified demo version created to explain the concept to school students in an engaging and visual way as part of NASA Space Apps outreach efforts.

## 🧠 Overview

Expurgo Re-Tyre is an environmental technology concept developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge.

It proposes a strap-on, multi-layered emission-absorbing tyre pad that actively absorbs harmful gases such as CO₂, CO, and SO₂ as vehicles move.

## 🌫 Problem Statement

Air pollution is a growing global crisis.

- 76% of Indians live in areas that do not meet national air quality standards  
- Impacts include:
  - Reduced birth weight  
  - Impaired child growth  
  - Obesity  
  - Bladder cancer  
- Children and the elderly are disproportionately affected  
- Only 19% of Indians are aware of the severity of air pollution

## 💡 Proposed Solution

### Expurgo Re-Tyre Pad

A multi-layer emission-absorbing pad that fits onto vehicle tyres.

### ⚙ How It Works

The pad consists of three layers:

1. Gas absorption layer (hydrated sodium carbonate compound)  
2. Structural reinforcement layer  
3. Protective outer layer  

As the vehicle moves, harmful gases are absorbed from the surrounding air.

## 📊 Scientific Validation

Hydrated sodium carbonate demonstrates:

- Up to **282 mg/g CO₂ absorption within 60 minutes**
- High viability for scalable implementation  
- Recyclability and cost efficiency

## 📱 Smart App Integration

### Features

- Real-time gas absorption tracking  
- Sensor-based data collection  
- Cloud processing (Google Cloud)  
- ML-powered personalized analytics  
- Route tracking  
- Data visualizations  
- Gamified badges & social sharing
